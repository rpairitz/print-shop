VERSION 0.1.0
-------------
In this version, we built basic components and navigation around the site.  A sign up scree, shop page, navigation bar, and contact us page were made and can be navigated via a list of links.

VERSION 0.2.0
-------------
In this version, we moved everything from Preact and made it in React.  All preact elements have been deleted and the site is fully functional in react.  We also added Parse into our site.

VERSION 0.3.0
-------------
In this version, protected routes were established as well as authenticating user log ins and registration.  Once logged in, you have access to the checkout and you can create an account via the registration page.  After making an account, that info is saved in the data base so it does not need to be used every time a user returns to the site.  Checkout cannot be accessed unless successfully logged in and log in cannot be accessed if logged in.
